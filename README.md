I am a Cleveland High School computer science student. THroughout my highschool career, I have amny computer science related projects.

### Student Secector

I worked in a group of three to create a chrome extention to take lists of students and be able to randomly select students. 

[Here](https://github.com/Benji-Wan-Kenobi/StudentSelectorExtension) is the GitHub repository.

### Web Scraper

This assignment I created a program to check a given URL until there is a change made to the page. [This](https://github.com/Benji-Wan-Kenobi/webscaper) was a project I did early on, so it is somewhat simple.

### Raspberry Pi

I have also done a lot of work with raspberry pi, creating programs and editing pre-exsisting programs to just explore. None of that is really documented.

### Student Sport List

I'm currently working on a program that takes sport schedules and lists of students to provide what students have a sporting even when. This is still a work in progress.

Also this website I have created!
